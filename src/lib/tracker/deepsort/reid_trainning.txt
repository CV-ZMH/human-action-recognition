Training
# run loop

    1. build trainer
        # general training loop
        methods
            - [x] move 'get_tqdm_iter'  method to runner class

    2. build runner
       # control
            - training / testing variables
            - classifier / siamese network
            - tensorboard writer
            - loss calculation / track loss
            - metric (acc score) calculation / track scores
            - after finished train / test, write loss, scores, images preidction
            - after finished epoch, append the result data to write json and csv
            - after finished a run, reset the variables and close tensorboard
            - save the result data to csv and json files


#%%
trainer = trainer(runner, data_loaders, model, loss_fn, metrics)
trainer.fit(total_epoch, start_lr)
